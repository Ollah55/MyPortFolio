        <p>
          My name is Taiwo Olanrewaju Moyosoreoluwa. I was born in Lagos, Nigeria, where I also completed my primary and secondary education. 
          I later studied Pure and Applied Chemistry at Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Oyo State.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve always been passionate about computers and technology, which led me to pursue fullstack development at Nupat Technology. 
          It's been an exciting journey, and today I’m proud to call myself a frontend developer.
